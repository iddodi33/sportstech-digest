## ATS Adapters

All adapters follow the `BaseAdapter` pattern in `adapters/base.py`: `fetch()` returns a normalised list of job dicts; `run()` orchestrates upserts and source-tracking stamps.

**Greenhouse** (`boards-api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/{slug}/jobs?content=true`) — simple JSON GET, description in `content` field. Most reliable adapter.

**Ashby** — GraphQL-style POST to `jobs.ashbyhq.com`, returns `descriptionPlain` or falls back to stripping `descriptionHtml`.

**Lever** — REST JSON list at `api.lever.co/v0/postings/{slug}?mode=json`, description in `text.description` or `lists`.

**Personio** — `search.json` list endpoint always returns empty `description` (server-side rendered). Fix: fetches per-job HTML detail page and extracts from `<script type="application/ld+json">`.

**Breezy** — `/json` endpoint returns published positions as a flat list. Description field present but not always populated. Returns `[]` for empty boards; adapter correctly calls `mark_source_attempted` (not `mark_source_successful`).

**BambooHR** — `{slug}.bamboohr.com/careers/list` returns JSON (not HTML). Job detail URL: `{slug}.bamboohr.com/careers/{id}`. Descriptions not fetched at list stage — `summary` is None. **EA Sports historic note:** BambooHR source pointed at wrong slug ("ea") which belongs to a social-services org — deactivated 2026-05-28, 29 misattributed jobs deleted, replaced with LinkedIn fallback.

**Teamtailor** — Primary path: JSON:API at `{custom_domain}/jobs.json`. Stats Perform CDN (section.io) returns 406 → falls back to HTML scraping of `careers_url`. Stats Perform's careers page is JS-rendered, so HTML fallback returns 0 jobs. **Known limitation, accepted.** Stats Perform migrated to `linkedin_only` as of 2026-05-28.

**Workday** — Uses undocumented but stable `POST /wday/cxs/{tenant}/{site}/jobs` (same as the careers site JS calls). No description in list response; fetches per-job HTML page and extracts from JSON-LD. Adds ~0.3s per job. URL pattern: `{tenant}.wd{N}.myworkdayjobs.com/.../{slug}/job/{Office-CC}/...`. The `/job/{Office-CC}/` segment is used by `_check_fdi_geography_allowlisted` to disambiguate "Multiple Locations" — see Classifier section. Tenant examples: `flutterbe` (Flutter), `draftkings` (DraftKings).

**Rippling** — Adapter code exists. **Zero active sources.** `rippling` is not an allowed value in the `ats_platform` CHECK constraint — adding sources requires `ALTER TABLE` first.

**Phenom** — Adapter code exists. Zero active sources currently.

**LinkedIn/Serper** — See dedicated section below.

## Source Tracking Semantics

Two timestamps on `company_careers_sources`, set in `adapters/base.py` `run()` finally block:

- `last_scrape_run_at` — stamped on every run attempt via `mark_source_attempted`, regardless of outcome.
- `last_successful_scrape_at` — stamped only when `upserted_count > 0` via `mark_source_successful`. A run that fetches 0 jobs (empty board, broken endpoint, CDN block) does NOT update this column.

The archive sweep health gate uses `last_successful_scrape_at` with an 8-day window. A silently-failing adapter (0 jobs, no exception) will eventually lose its health status after 8 days, protecting its jobs from being archived.

Weekly email status: `_aggregate()` in `weekly/runner.py` sets `status="warning"` when `scraped == 0` and no exception was raised, `"failed"` on exception, `"success"` otherwise. Warning rows render in amber (#b85c00) in the email.

## Classifier Flow

### Stage 1 — Python rule pre-filter (`classifier.py:run_rules()`)

**Rule 1 — `too_junior`:** rejects on title word-boundary match against:
`junior`, `intern`, `internship`, `entry level`, `entry-level`, `trainee`, `apprentice`
`"graduate"` was intentionally removed 2026-05-28 — let Haiku decide seniority on graduate roles.

**Rule 2 — FDI geography:** only fires when `is_fdi=True AND is_irish_founded=False`.

```
if is_fdi and not is_irish_founded:
    if is_fdi_allowlisted:
        geo = _check_fdi_geography_allowlisted(location_raw, url)
    else:
        geo = _check_fdi_geography(location_raw)
    if geo == "reject": → status=rejected, reason=fdi_geography
    else: → continue to Haiku
```

`_check_fdi_geography` (non-allowlisted FDIs) — Ireland-eligible list checked first (Dublin, Cork, Galway, remote EMEA, etc.); ambiguous multi-location strings ("Multiple Locations", "N Locations") auto-reject; definitive non-Ireland strings (US cities/states, London, Madrid, Berlin, Singapore, etc.) reject; unknown → pending.

`_check_fdi_geography_allowlisted` (18 allowlisted FDIs) — Ireland+UK eligible list checked first (all Irish locations plus London, Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Bristol, Sheffield, Liverpool, Newcastle, Cardiff, Derry, Antrim, `uk`, `united kingdom`, `england`, `scotland`, `wales`, `remote - uk`, EMEA); ambiguous multi-location strings attempt a URL fallback before returning pending (see below); definitive non-Ireland/UK strings reject; unknown → pending.

**URL fallback for ambiguous locations** (added 2026-05-28): when `location_raw` matches `_AMBIGUOUS_LOC` ("locations", "multiple") or `_N_LOCATIONS_RE` ("N Locations"), and a `url` is provided, the function parses the Workday `/job/{Office-CC}/` path segment. It lowercases and replaces `-` with spaces, then checks against:
- Ireland markers (`dublin`, `ireland`, ` ie`, etc.) → `"pass"`
- UK markers (`london`, `leeds`, ` uk`, `england`, etc.) → `"pass"`
- Reject markers (US state codes ` ma`, ` ny`, ` ca`, etc.; major US cities; `sofia`, `plovdiv`, ` bg`, `singapore`, `dubai`, `barcelona`, `berlin`, `colombia`, `gibraltar`, `usa`) → `"reject"`
- No match → falls through to `"pending"`

### Stage 2 — Haiku classification (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`)

Receives: company name, vertical, is_fdi flag, description snippet, job title, location, summary (max 1500 chars).

Returns JSON with 10 fields: `seniority`, `employment_type`, `remote_status`, `vertical`, `location_normalised`, `sportstech_relevance`, `sportstech_relevance_reason`, `job_function`, `classification_reasoning`, `summary_excerpt`.

`sportstech_relevance` values:
- `relevant` → job stays `pending` (admin review)
- `ambiguous` → job stays `pending`
- `not_sportstech` → job set to `rejected`, reason `not_sportstech`

**`job_function` normaliser** (updated 2026-05-28): before the enum check, applies `re.sub(r'\s*\([^)]*\)\s*$', '', v)` to strip verbose Haiku responses like `"Engineering (software/hardware/devops/QA/infrastructure roles)"` down to `"Engineering"`. 8 valid values: `Engineering`, `Data & Analytics`, `Product & Design`, `Sales & Business Development`, `Marketing & Content`, `Operations`, `Customer Success`, `Other`.

`summary_excerpt` — max 400 chars, plain text. Haiku instructed to describe what the role involves day-to-day, skipping company intros and boilerplate. Null if description is too thin.

`max_tokens` = 1224 (bumped from 1024 to accommodate summary_excerpt output).

### Re-classification note

`run_classifier.py` only processes jobs with `status='pending' AND classification IS NULL`. Once classified, a job is permanently excluded from the normal classifier loop. To re-evaluate historical rejected jobs, reset them to `status='pending', classification=null, rejected_reason=null` in SQL first.

`run_reclassify_all.py` fills `job_function` on all jobs where `job_function IS NULL` (any status) — it does NOT re-evaluate accept/reject decisions.

## LinkedIn / Serper Adapter

Four-stage process per company in `adapters/linkedin.py`:

**Stage 1 — Serper discovery**
Query format:
- Indigenous companies: `site:linkedin.com/jobs/view "{search_name}"`
- FDI companies: `site:linkedin.com/jobs/view "{search_name}" Ireland`

`linkedin_search_name` field on `company_careers_sources` overrides `company_name` in the query. Active overrides as of 2026-05-28: EA Sports → `"Electronic Arts"`, Stats Perform → `"Stats Perform"`, ggCircuit → `"ggCircuit"`, Orreco → `"ORRECO"`, Off The Ball, Clubforce, Danu Sports (exact names set per source row).

Returns up to 10 LinkedIn job-view URLs from Serper organic results.

**Stage 2 — Domain filter**
Indigenous companies: accept `ie.linkedin.com` and `www.linkedin.com`.
FDI companies: accept `ie.linkedin.com` only.

**Stage 3 — LinkedIn page fetch**
GET with rotating User-Agent and 1.5–2.5s throttle. Session refreshed with 60–90s sleep every 25 fetches. Returns raw HTML, or `_RATE_LIMITED` sentinel on 999/429, or `None` on error.

**Stage 4 — Name validation**
Parses `hiringOrganization.name` from JSON-LD. Normalises both names (lowercase, strip legal suffixes, collapse whitespace). Accepts exact match and trailing-s variation (Sport/Sports). When `linkedin_search_name` override is set: skips equality check, still rejects if hiring_org is absent.

**Stage 5 — Posted-age check** (added 2026-05-28)
Constant: `MAX_POSTED_AGE_DAYS = 90`

`_extract_posted_days_ago(html)`:
1. JSON-LD `datePosted` ISO timestamp (preferred — precise).
2. Regex fallback: `"(?:Posted|Reposted)\s+(\d+)\s+(hour|day|week|month|year)s?\s+ago"` — converts hours→0 days, weeks→×7, months→×30, years→×365.
3. Returns `None` if neither method finds a date.

Behaviour:
- `None` → log warning, allow job (lenient on missing data).
- `> MAX_POSTED_AGE_DAYS` → reject with reason `"posted_too_old (N days)"`, count in `stale_age`.
- Otherwise → allow.

Per-source summary log format:
```
linkedin: '{company}' serper=N domain_filter=N fetched=N validated=N
errors: 999=N parse=N name_mismatch=N stale_age=N bypassed=N
```

---

## Archive Sweep (`run_archive_sweep.py`)

Runs after classifier each week. Operates only on jobs with `status IN ('approved', 'pending')` — rejected jobs are never archived.

For each such job:
1. Source must have a recorded `last_successful_scrape_at`.
2. Source health gate: `last_successful_scrape_at >= now - 8 days`. If unhealthy (failing adapter), job is skipped.
3. `cutoff = last_successful_scrape_at - 8 days`. If `last_seen_in_scrape_run < cutoff` → archive.
4. Jobs with `NULL last_seen_in_scrape_run` (legacy rows) are always exempt.

---

## FDI Allowlist

18 FDI sportstech companies have `fdi_classifier_allowlisted=true` on their `companies` row (set 2026-05-28). These companies' jobs bypass the strict Ireland-only geography and instead use `_check_fdi_geography_allowlisted` (Ireland+UK eligible):

Blizzard Entertainment, Catapult, DraftKings, EA Sports, Fanatics, Fitbit, Flutter Entertainment, Genius Sports, ggCircuit, Hudl, LiveScore, PFF (Pro Football Focus), Riot Games, Stats Perform, Strava, Teamworks, Thrive Global, WHOOP.

To add a new company to the allowlist: `UPDATE companies SET fdi_classifier_allowlisted = true WHERE name = '...';` — then verify an active `company_careers_sources` row exists for it.
